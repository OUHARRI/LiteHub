# LiteHub



## Project Context:
The aim of this project is to build an online community for book enthusiasts. Members will be able to create reading groups, participate in online discussions, and discover new books. Additionally, they can share their thoughts and feelings about the books they have read.

## Development Instructions:

* As a user, I can create an account and log in to access my personal space.
* As a user, I can update or delete my profile.
* As a user, I can explore a wide range of digital books.
* As a user, I can add books to my favorites list.
* As a user, I can browse books and use filters (by category, label, or date) to find books of interest.
* As a user, I can rate a book (using a 5-star rating system) and express my opinion (like or dislike).
* As a user, I can create or join interest-based reading groups and delete my own reading group.
* As a user, I can initiate and moderate online discussions about books with my reading group members.

### As an admin, I can:

* View all registered users and their profiles.
* View all reading groups and their members.
* Add, edit, or delete a book category.
* Add, edit, or archive a book.

## Technological Constraints:

* Use the PHP Laravel framework, including Auth, Model, Controller, Middlewares, Routing, Migrations, and Seeds.
* Use HTML5, CSS Frameworks, and JavaScript frameworks (with optional APIs), and AJAX (optional) to enhance user experience.

### Best Practices:

* Use Laravel's frameworks and libraries to improve the user experience.
* Provide a smooth and personalized user experience with Laravel.

## Bonuses:

* Allow users to retrieve their last read book.
* Offer book recommendations based on members' preferences and reading history.
* Display a monthly ranking of the most popular books.
* Provide a PDF reader tool to read books.
* Offer an audio version of books.
* Send notifications to users for newly added books, reading group updates, and more.

## Performance Criteria:

* Use meaningful class and variable names to make the code readable and understandable.
* Thoroughly document the code for easy maintenance and collaboration with other developers.
* Optimize site performance using caching, data compression, and minimizing database queries.
* Develop the site in compliance with web standards, making it compatible with modern browsers and adhering to best practices for web accessibility.
* Regularly back up the site's code and data to prevent data loss in the event of a technical issue.
